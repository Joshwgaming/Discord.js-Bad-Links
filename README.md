# Discord.js-Bad-Links
Delete and mute a user for posting links commonly found on hacked accounts.


How to set up:
- Download the BadLinks.json file.
- Copy the contents of the index.js file into your existing index.js file. (The main file that runs your bot)
- Drag the badLinks.json file into the same folder as your index.js file.
- Replace "mute role id" on line 9 of index.js with your discord muted role ID.


NOTE: This is not a fully working bot code. You will need to already have a working discord.js bot with an existing index.js code file for this to work.
